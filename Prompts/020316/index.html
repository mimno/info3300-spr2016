	<h3>Prompt for Wednesday, Feb 3. Scalable Vector Graphics</h3>

	<div>
		SVG is an XML specification of vector graphics. Visual elements are represented as tags, which have styles and attributes. 
	</div>
	<div>
		1. Polylines. How does SVG understand coordinates?
		<svg height="400" width="400">
		</svg>
	</div>
	<div>
		2. Paths. This is the most complicated SVG element, but also one of the most useful. It contains <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData">a tiny programming language</a>.
		<svg height="400" width="400">
		</svg>
	</div>
	<div>
		3. Transformations are another useful (but a bit tricky) tool. How do we stretch, rotate, and shift elements, and how does the order of these operations affect the result?

	<h3>Discussion: Minard's Map</h3>
	<div>Edward Tufte popularized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minard.png">this map by Charles Minard of Napoleon's disastrous Russian invasion</a> as the greatest visual presentation of data ever. How many different variables is Minard presenting? What is he choosing NOT to present? (Is this actually a map?) What elements would you use to copy this "carte figurative" in SVG?
