	<h3>Prompt for Friday, Feb. 5. Arrays. Introduction to D3</h3>

<!-- Here's a standard HTML div element with an ID and a class -->
<div id="d1" class="header">Hello!</div>

<!-- Here's an SVG canvas element. Note that in this file it looks like the <div> above. -->
<svg height="200" width="200">
  <!-- Visual elements are represented by tags, which have attributes -->
</svg>

	<div>
		We'll start by using d3 to select DOM elements, create new elements, and modify the content and appearance of elements. 
	</div>
	<div>
		1. How can we select elements? What is the difference between select() and selectAll()?

	<h3>Gravitational covers, Jan Willem Tulp</h3>
	<div>
		The <a href="https://lab.interactivethings.com/galaxy-of-covers/">Galaxy of Covers</a> shows information about the most commonly covered songs. We've been thinking of graphics as ways of transforming tables of data into visual elements. What are the "scales" that this tool is using? How effective are they? What do you notice first, and how accurately could you reconstruct the original data table?
	</div>
	<div>
		I heard about this via Twitter from designer Jan Willem Tulp, who has a 
		great <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/2015/12/six-questions-with-jan-willem-tulp/">interview with Andy Kirk</a>. Both of them are worth paying attention to!
