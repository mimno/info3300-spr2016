Natural Amenities Scale

The Climatic data is from the Area Resource File (ARF). The ARF file is maintained by 
Quality Resource Systems (QRS) under contract to the Office of Research and Planning, Bureau of
Health Professions, within the Health Resources and Services Administration.  For more information
see http://www.arfsys.com .

The topography scale is from The National Atlas of the United States of America
U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Washington, DC., 1970.

Land Surface Form Topography codes:

Plains,Tablelands,Plains with Hills or Mountains,
1 = Flat plains,5 = Tablelands, moderate relief,9 = Plains with hills,
2 = Smooth plains,6 = Tablelands, considerable relief,10 = Plains with high hills,
3 = Irregular plains, slight relief,7 = Tablelands, high relief,11 = Plains with low mountains,
4 = Irregular plains,8 = Tablelands, very high relief,12 = Plains with high mountains,
 
Open Hills and Mountains,Hills and Mountains
13 = Open low hills,18 = Hills
14 = Open hills,19 = High hills
15 = Open high hills,20 = Low mountains

Metro counties:

 1   Large - Central and fringe counties of metro areas of 1 million
     population or more 
 2   Small - Counties in metro areas of fewer than 1 million population

Nonmetro counties:

 3   Adjacent to a large metro area with a city of 10,000 or more,
 4   Adjacent to a large metro area without a city of at least 10,000,
 5   Adjacent to a small metro area with a city of 10,000 or more,
 6   Adjacent to a small metro area without a city of at least 10,000,

Census Divisions

2 = Middle Atlantic,
3 = East  North Central,

Amenity Rank (See map in publication)

Deviations from the mean,
1 = Over -2 (Low),
2 = -1 to -2,
3 = 0 to -1,
4 = 0 to 1,
5 = 1 to 2,
6 = 2 to 3 ,
7 = Over 3 (High),

Notes:  The file consists of an amenity code for all of the counties in the lower 48 states.
In some cases where the data was not available, estimates were used from a 
combined adjacent county.  There are 41 combined counties in this file.  Most of
of these combination were the independent cities in Virginia. There  were also county
combinations in Arizona, Montana, and New Mexico.
