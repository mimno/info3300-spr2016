<h3>Bar plots</h3>

<p>We will be recreating bar plots from <a href="https://medium.com/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4">Punctuation in Novels</a>.</p>

<div id="plot"></div>

<script>

var height = 200;
var width = 300;
var padding = 100; // Use a wide padding so we can spot a problem with bars.

var svg = d3.select("#plot").append("svg")
.attr("height", height).attr("width", width);

// Moby Dick is actually pretty funny.
var novel = "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.";

// The //g is how we do "replaceAll", which doesn't exist in JS.

	var count = {};
	var keys = [];
	list.forEach(function (x) {
		if (count[x]) { count[x]++; }
		else { keys.push(x); count[x] = 1; }

// An ordinal scale for elements, like <rect>, that have width.
//  See https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Ordinal-Scales#ordinal_rangeBands
var yBands = d3.scale.ordinal()

.rangeRoundBands([10, height], 0.5); // The 0.5 controls how much space goes between bars.

// An ordinal scale for elements that we want to center.
// (A text has width, but we don't control it easily)
//  https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Ordinal-Scales#ordinal_rangePoints
var yPoints = d3.scale.ordinal()
.domain(punctCounts.keys)
.rangePoints([10, height], 1.0); // The 1.0 controls how far the first and last points are from the extreme pixel values.

.range([padding, width - padding]);

// We'll replace the 0s with functions
punctCounts.keys.forEach(function (p) {
	svg.append("text").attr("x", xScale(0) - padding / 2)
	.attr("y", yPoints(p))
	.text(p);
	
	// Here's the tricky part: We need to set the width of
	//  the bars to the *distance* in pixels from the 
	//  left to the right, but xScale gives us the *position*
	//  of the right side of the bar.
	
	svg.append("rect")
	.attr("x", xScale(0))
	.attr("y", yBands(p))
	.attr("class", "dullorange")
	.attr("height", yBands.rangeBand())
