	<h3>Notes for Monday, Feb 1. SVG and interaction</h3>

<!-- Here's a standard HTML div element with an ID and a class -->
<div id="d1" class="header">Hello!</div>

<!-- Here's an SVG canvas element. Note that in this file it looks like the <div> above. -->
<svg height="200" width="200">
  <!-- Visual elements are represented by tags, which have attributes -->
  <circle cx="30" cy="30" r="10" id="c1" />
</svg>

<!-- Here are two types of form inputs. -->
<input id="t1" type="text" value="Hello!"/>
<input id="slider" type="range" min="0" max="100" value="30"/>

<div>
We will be using Javascript to manipulate element of the page. 
</div>
<div>
1. Text elements, like the "Hello!" above.
<script>
// Our goal today is to show (a) what properties are available to us on 
//  regular HTML elements and SVG elements, and (b) that modifying them
//  directly from javascript can be confusing and difficult.
// On Friday we'll see an API (d3) that makes things easier -- but I want
//  you to appreciate why we like it.

// We can modify attributes of an element
document.getElementById("d1").innerText = "Buon giorno!";
// Note that since getElementById returns an object, we can "chain" 
//  multiple commands.

// The Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page distinguishes 
//  between attributes and styles.
document.getElementById("d1").style.color = "#f00";
// Your browser's Javascript console gives you a good interface to scan
//  the attributes and styles available to you.

</script>
</div>
<div>
2. Our first look at SVG.
<script>
// Shapes are just tags! We can grab references to them, like elements.
var circle = document.getElementById("c1");
// But we can't directly set properties like we did with the regular
//  HTML element.
circle.setAttribute("cx", 100);

//circle.cy = 150; <-- Doesn't work!
circle.setAttribute("cy", 150);
// The "x" axis is left to right, but the "y" axis is top to bottom -- 
//  the opposite of standard Cartesian coordinates, but ordinary for graphics.

// Styles work just like standard HTML, but the names of the styles
//  may not be what you expect.
circle.style.fill = "#f00";
circle.style.stroke = "#000";


// During class we noticed that I had accidentally used a variable "c1"
//  that worked even though I hadn't declared it. This turns out to be
//  an inconsistently implemented feature. This article describes it
//  and suggests that we avoid it.
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3434278/do-dom-tree-elements-with-ids-become-global-variables

</script>
</div>
<div>
3. Interactive form elements. 
<script>
// Form inputs are also elements.
var slider = document.getElementById("slider");
// Some properties of elements are numbers (scrollTop) or strings (color).
// Others are functions! These functions define behaviors.
// The "onchange" attribute, which was a reasonable guess, turned out
//  to only fire an event when you *release* the slider.
// An alert StackOverflow reader discovered the right event: oninput.
slider.oninput = function () {
	var circle = document.getElementById("c1");
	circle.setAttribute("r", slider.value);
};
</script>
</div>
	
	<h3>Discussion</h3>
	<div>Try this <a href="http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html">interactive demonstration of a deep neural network</a>. The input image appears on the bottom, and the predicted digit classification at the top. Each "layer" of the network represents a "view" of some part of the level beneath it. How is the author mapping the parts of the model to visual elements? How are the interactions between layers represented? What did you learn about deep neural networks, and what is confusing? Is this page successful?
	</div>
	<div>
		A bit more about this page: the input you draw is split into a grid of binary pixels, shown at the bottom of the page. This is the first layer of the neural network, the observed layer. The second layer is shown in the six "images" immediately above. Each "pixel" in these images is a function of a small subset of the pixels in the first layer. You can see which ones when you mouse over. Why are the six images different? Each one is weighting different patterns differently, so they appear to highlight different types of edges. I believe the color of the lines that appear when you hover over a pixel determine the weight (positive or negative) of the pixel. Each subsequent layer operates the same way: the value of a pixel depends on a subset of the pixels in the next lower layer, which you can see by mousing over.
