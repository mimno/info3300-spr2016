	<h3>Notes for Friday, Jan. 29. What's different about Javascript?</h3>

	<div>
		This class will work almost entirely in Javascript. There are several idioms in Javascript that we'll use a lot, but that you may not be familiar with from other languages. For some of things we will use additional libraries, but we want to do things the hard way first!
	</div>
	<div>
		Javascript has a simple type system. The <tt>typeof</tt> function can tell us the type of a variable. 
		<div id="target"></div>

<script>

// Here's how we declare a variable:
var x = 3.1;

// JS doesn't distinguish between integers and floating point numbers.
typeof(3);
typeof(Math.PI);

// Strings are a type, but characters aren't.
typeof("Ithaca");
typeof('i');

// Note: to get this to work you may need to specify View -> Encoding -> UTF-8.
var hello = "ä½ å¥½"; // Any unicode character is valid in a string literal.
var ä½ å¥½ = "hello"; // Any LETTER unicode character is valid as the start of a variable name

var smiley =  "ðŸ˜€";  // Yes! Emojis are Unicode characters.
// var ðŸ˜€ = "smiley"; // NO! But they are a different type of character than letters.

// Strings have functions. Chrome gives you a nice summary.
if ("Ithaca".endsWith("a")) {
	console.log("It does");
}
// Also, that's how you do a conditional and write to the console (good for debugging).

// Other types are booleans
typeof("Ithaca".endsWith("a"));

// Javascript Object Notation (JSON) is a great way to send structured data between programs.
// Most languages support it, but valid JSON also happens to be valid Javascript.
//   http://www.json.org

var myArray = [ 1, 2, "big" ];  // Notice that arrays are not typed. (They CAN be, but only if you ask.)
var myObject = { x : 3, y : "ðŸ˜€", z : myArray };  // Property names must be strings, values can be anything.

// There's no way (in this version of JS) to ask an object to list its property names.
// We use this function in the Object class:
Object.getOwnPropertyNames([1, 2, 3]);

// Note that arrays are implemented as objects with fancy properties and some syntactic "sugar".
console.log(myArray[2]);
console.log(myArray["2"]);

// More syntactic help. You can write regular expressions like this:
var pattern = /[aeiou]/g;
console.log("ithaca".replace(pattern, "V"));
// But regexps are still just objects!

// Here's the really important type: function.

function getType(x) { return typeof(x); }
function bold(x) { return "<b>" + x + "</b>"; }

typeof(getType);

// The first argument can be any variable, the second must be a function.
function display (variable, modifier) {
	document.getElementById("target").innerHTML =
	  variable + " " + modifier(variable);
}

// Since functions are values, we can pass them as arguments.
display(3.0, getType);

// Usually when we pass a function as an argument we want to change a behavior.
// Try changing "getType" to "bold".

	<h3>Discussion</h3>
	<div>What do you think of the barplot on this page?
		<a href=" http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/01/as-voter-id-laws-expand-fewer-people-are-getting-drivers-licenses/431547/">Drivers licenses by age, over time</a>.
		What do the authors want to tell you? How are they choosing
		to represent numbers visually? How easy is it to compare two numbers?
		Would other ways of displaying the same data highlight other
		aspects? Is there something weird about the dates?
	</div>
		<h3>Further examples of javascript function patterns, which might be useful on homework.</h3>
	<div>
		Javascript is functional, which means that functions are values. There are two different ways of defining functions.
		<span id="functions"></span>
		<script>
		function plusOne(x) { return x + 1; }
		
		var addOneAlternate = function(x) { return x + 1; };
		</script>
	</div>
	<div>
		Some functions take other functions as inputs. Other functions return functions.
		<span id="func_as_input"></span>
		<span id="func_as_output"></span>
		<script>
		var operate = function(x, operator) { return operator(x); }
		document.getElementById("func_as_input").innerHTML = operate(7, plusOne);
		
		var plusGenerator = function(offset) { return function(x) { return x + offset } };
		var addTwo = plusGenerator(2);
		document.getElementById("func_as_output").innerHTML = addTwo(15);
		
		</script>
	</div>
	<div>
		Functions remember the values of variables at the time they were created.
		<script>
		var favoriteColor = "blue";
		function colorGenerator(color) {
			return function () { return color; };
		}
		var getColor = colorGenerator(favoriteColor);
		favoriteColor = "green";
		
		// What is getColor() ?
		</script>
	</div>
